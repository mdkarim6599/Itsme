             scan extensive coded
            manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a
            successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of
            text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions
            included in the coded manual. Users interact with websites and apps with
            the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up
            on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or
            programmer asks the computer to display. Coding tells a machine which
            actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages
            provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based
            technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately
            communicate with machines.

             of switches operate a
            device. High-level code, a computer communication process that works
            much like human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems
            simultaneously. High-level programming languages convert human language
            from programmers into binary code that computers understand.

            with user accounts, like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn, require
            back-end developers to write computer code that connects websites to
            databases. Back-end developers often write code using languages such as
            SQL, Java, and Python. Developers use other languages like Python,
            Objective-C, C#, Swift, or Ruby on Rails to create apps for cell phones
            and computer software. Below, we list popular programming languages and
            their most common uses.
